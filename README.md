3. **CISCO PACKET TRACER**

    1. Configure an FTP server in Cisco Packet Tracer. Describe the steps and configurations required to set up the FTP server and demonstrate file transfer operations between the server and a client.
    2. Configure a DHCP server in Cisco Packet Tracer. Detail the process for setting up the server, including IP address pool creation, and show how clients obtain IP addresses dynamically. 
    3. Set up a DNS and Web server in Cisco Packet Tracer. Explain how to configure the DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses and how to configure the web server to serve a basic web page.
    4. Simulate an email server in Cisco Packet Tracer. Provide instructions on configuring the server for sending and receiving emails, and demonstrate email communication between clients.
    5. Configure a wireless LAN (WLAN) in Cisco Packet Tracer. Describe the steps to set up a wireless router and connect devices wirelessly. Test the network connectivity and data transfer between devices.  
    6. Implement and configure RIP v1 in Cisco Packet Tracer. Detail the process of configuring RIP on routers and verify the routing information exchange and connectivity between network segments.
    7. Set up OSPF routing in Cisco Packet Tracer. Explain the configuration of OSPF on routers and show how OSPF dynamically updates routing tables for network segments.
    8. Configure static routing in Cisco Packet Tracer. Provide a step-by-step guide to manually setting up static routes on routers and demonstrate how packets are routed across different network segments.
